## User Story

* As a developer, I want to create a database that allows users to search for movie

* When I view the site on different screens
Then the application is responsive

* When I search for movie titles
Then results populate and information about films is given

* When I refresh the page Then the previous search shows

* When I click the modal Then a newsletter sign up appears

* When you load up the application Then you have a popular section 

## Usage
Click the "more" icon (the three dots) to view the description for each film.  Use the searchbar to search for your favorite films and NewFlix will remember your last search.  You can also use the modal to sign up for the weekly newsletter.
